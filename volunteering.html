                <h4>EVA, FEMALE, YEARS OLD</h4>
                <p>I joined Reuse Volunteer in 2020 during a Recycle Seminar. It was very enlightening and after the
                  seminar, I knew in my heart that I wanted to join the volunteer program and be part of this world
                  changing exercise. As a beginner then, I was passionate and proactive; I went further to know more
                  about the organisation and its policies, the more I knew the more passionate I became. I have attended
                  about 20 Paper-pick campaigns and during that time, I try to educate people on recycling. I have
                  earned my school the position of Recycler of the month once, while I have been featured as volunteer
                  of the month twice. These positions have earned me a lot in applying for eco-friendly and
                  environmental sustainability roles.
